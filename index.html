      <p>Hi, I'm Max Szczepaniak, professional human, full-time barista for now. I deal with aggrigatation and redistribution of audio/visual media.</p>

      <p>That's a fancy way of saying that I like to remix and edit videos and music. I've accepted the fact that the only thing about me that is wholly my own is my perspective and now I'm trying to share.</p>

      <p>I don't really know what to put here but I will put stuff anyways.  I feel like I should apologize for the sporadic nature of this block of text. How are you? I hope you are feeling well. I hope your day is going well.</p>
